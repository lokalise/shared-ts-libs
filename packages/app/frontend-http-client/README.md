# Frontend HTTP client

Opinionated HTTP client for the frontend.

Note that it is a ESM-only package.

## Basic usage

```ts
import wretch from 'wretch'
import { z } from 'zod/v4'

const client = wretch('http://localhost:8000')

const queryParamsSchema = z.object({
	param1: z.string(),
	param2: z.number(),
})

const requestBodySchema = z.object({
	requestCode: z.number(),
})

const responseBodySchema = z.object({
	success: z.boolean(),
})

const responseBody = await sendPost(client, {
	path: '/',
	body: { requestCode: 100 },
	queryParams: { param1: 'test', param2: 123 },
	queryParamsSchema,
	requestBodySchema,
	responseBodySchema,
})
```

### No content response handling (HTTP 204)

SDK methods has a parameter (`isEmptyResponseExpected`) to specify if 204 response should be treated as an error or not. By default it is treated as
valid except on `sendGet` method where it is treated as an error. Usage example:

```ts
const response = await sendGet(client, {
	path: '/',
	isEmptyResponseExpected: true,
})
```

if `204` responses are expected, the library will return null, if not, it will throw an error.

### Non-JSON response handling

SDK methods has a parameter (`isNonJSONResponseExpected`) to specify if non json responses should be treated as an error
or not. By default it is treated as valid except on `sendGet` method where it is treated as an error. Usage example:

```ts
const response = await sendGet(client, {
	path: '/',
	isNonJSONResponseExpected: true,
})
```

if non-JSON responses are expected, the library will return null, if not, it will throw an error.

### API contract-based requests

`frontend-http-client` supports using API contracts, created with `@lokalise/api-contracts` in order to make fully type-safe HTTP requests.

Usage example:

```ts
import { somePostRouteDefinition, someGetRouteDefinition } from 'some-service-api-contracts'
import { sendByPayloadRoute } from '@lokalise/frontend-http-client'
import wretch from 'wretch'

const client = wretch(BASE_URL)

const responseBody1 = await sendByPayloadRoute(client, somePostRouteDefinition, {
    pathParams: {
        userId: 1,
    },
    body: {
        isActive: true,
    },
})

const responseBody2 = await sendByGetRoute(client, someGetRouteDefinition, {
    pathParams: {
        userId: 1,
    },
    queryParams: {
        id: 'testId',
    },
})
```

The following parameters can be specified when sending API contract-based requests:
- `body` - request body (only applicable for `sendByPayloadRoute`, type needs to match with contract definition)
- `queryParams` - query parameters (type needs to match with contract definition)
- `headers` - custom headers to be sent with the request (type needs to match with contract definition)
- `pathParams` – parameters used for path resolver (type needs to match with contract definition)
- `pathPrefix` - optional prefix to be prepended to the path resolved by the contract's path resolver

### Tracking request progress
Tracking requests progress is especially useful while uploading files. 

> **Important note**: `wretch` does not support request progress tracking, so we rely on XMLHttpRequest. That's why the interface of the method below is slightly different from the others 

Usage example:

```ts
 const response = await sendPostWithProgress({
    path: '/',
    data: new FormData(), 
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ...' }, 
    responseBodySchema: z.object(),
    onProgress: (progress) => {
        console.log(`Loaded ${progress.loaded} of ${progress.total}`)
    }
})
```

### Aborting pending requests
Aborting requests is especially useful while uploading files. 

> **Important note**: Currently it is only possible with `sendWithProgress()` function 

Usage example:

```ts
const abortController = new AbortController()

sendPostWithProgress({
    path: '/',
    data: new FormData(), 
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ...' },
    responseBodySchema: z.object(),
    onProgress: (progress) => {
        console.log(`Loaded ${progress.loaded} of ${progress.total}`)
    },
    abortController
})

abortController.abort()
```
